## Portfolio

# Introduction
This portfolio exists in order to show code examples to potential recruiters. It is currently being updated regularly to document my progress.

# Organisation
This portfolio currently only contains one folder named "Basics", which include code examples to show mastery of the basics of the Python programming languages. I plan on adding more folders in the future to show examples of my work.
