# Extract - Load

## Introduction

This python script is designed to take a list of stocks stored in stock.py and return daily metrics about it.

## To do

I still have to code the second part of this script, the "Load" section which is intended to stored the previously generated Pandas DataFrame into a Postgresql table.

I will write instructions as to how to run this script when it is completed.
